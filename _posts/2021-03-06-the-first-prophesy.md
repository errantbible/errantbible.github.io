It's not uncommon for inerrantists to point to Biblical prophesy as the proof that the Bible is inerrant. I've seen various estimates claiming that over 2000 prophesies in the Bible have been fulfilled, with over 300 by Jesus alone. Given the probability of all of these happening by chance, then surely we must conclude that these prophesies are the result of divine revelation. If these things have been divinely revealed in the Bible, then the Bible itself must also be divinely created.

Putting aside the [fallacy of composition](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Fallacy-of-Composition), another reason to discount this argument can best be explained with the first example of prophesy that we see in the Bible. It's probably very familiar to most of us, but let's recount it quickly:

Satan takes the form of a snake and tricks Adam and Eve into eating the forbidden fruit. Punishing all involved, God tells Satan:
>
And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel. (Genesis 3:15)

Since Jesus defeated death on the cross, we have our first Bible prophesy fulfilled.

But hold on a second...is this what Genesis actually says? Let's back up to the beginning of the chapter and see.

>
Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the Lord God had made. He said to the woman... (Genesis 3:1)

We are introduced to the serpent at the beginning of this chapter, and then the serpent is referenced four additional times throughout the chapter. At no point during this chapter is the serpent referred to as Satan or anything other than just a serpent. More so, the concept of an evil being that we call Satan [would have been entirely foreign the author of Genesis](https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-topics/bible-interpretation/how-the-serpent-became-satan/).

Let's examine the curse in its entirety
>
Cursed are you above all livestock and all wild animals! You will crawl on your belly and you will eat dust all the days of your life. And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel. (Genesis 3:14-15)

The first part of that curse doesn't seem to have much to do with Satan. Which of these makes more sense: God cursing Satan above all wild animals or God cursing the literal serpent above all wild animals? Has Satan been forced to crawl on his belly and eat dust all of his days? That doesn't make any sense. If the first half of this curse is to be taken literally, why do we all of a sudden change the last half to be some metaphorical prophesy about Jesus and him crushing Satan and death? Doesn't the passage make more sense as a mythical explanation of the relationship between humans and serpents?

There are, in fact,  no other references in the entire Bible speaking of the serpent in Genesis as any kind of Satan or Satanic figure.

If you knew nothing else of the Bible, but then read Genesis 3, would you have come to the conclusion that this was a prophesy about something that will happen in the future? If not, then how can this reasonably be called a prophesy? This is an example of creating prophesy after the fact. There is no prediction here. There is no hidden meaning. The passage makes complete sense without reading prophesy into it, and in fact makes *more* sense if you *don't* read prophesy into it. Christians searched the old testament looking for anything that could be considered a reference to Christ, saw Genesis 3:15, and labeled it prophesy because it fit the narrative.

If a prophetic passage makes *more* sense using a non-prophetic interpretation, then why not just read it that why? Inserting prophetic interpretation after the fact doesn't point to divine revelation; it points to biased interpreters.
