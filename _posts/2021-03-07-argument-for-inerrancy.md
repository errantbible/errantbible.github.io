Go searching for arguments defending inerrancy, and most often you'll find *negative* arguments: arguments that attempt to prove that inerrancy isn't contradicted by arguments made against it.

It's fairly uncommon to find *positive* arguments: arguments that attempt to prove inerrancy is something you should believe in. Often times, these arguments involve some kind of circular reasoning, i.e., the Bible is inerrant because the Bible itself claims itself to be true and trustworthy. The rhetoric usually isn't that overt but almost always boils down to such an argument at its core.

[Josh McDowell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_McDowell) does a fair amount of this in his apologetics tome, "Evidence That Demands a Verdict". But lo! A bright light shines in the distance! After discussing how trustworthy the Bible is because of all the things in the Bible, he asks the question, "Isn't this circular reasoning?"

Finally! Somebody who understands the tomfoolery of this logic. I'll finally get a good *postive* argument for why I should believe in inerrancy!

His answer
> But this is not the case. A logical presentation of the case for inerrancy is not circular.
>
> The Bible is a reliable and trustworthy document. This is established by treating it as any other historical record, as, for instance, the works of Josephus or the accounts of war by Julius Caesar.
>
> On the basis of the history recorded by the Bible, we have sufficient grounds for believing that the central character of the Bible, Jesus Christ, did what He is claimed to have done and therefore is who He claimed to be. He claimed to be the unique Son of God--in fact, God in human flesh. As the unique Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ is an infallible authority.

He goes on to say:
> This argument begins with the nature of the Bible in general, proceeds to the person and teaching of Jesus Christ, and concluded by adopting His teaching concerning the nature of the Bible.

I read this passage for the first time and was taken aback. This!? This is the best thing one of the greatest apologetics researchers ever has to offer? He's essentially saying that because we can archeologically verify many of the locations and events recorded in the Bible, this means that we can also trust *everything* it says about Jesus.

At its core, McDowell's argument suffers from the [fallacy of composition](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Fallacy-of-Composition). He's arguing that given we know parts of the Bible are true and trustworthy, we should believe that the Bible is true and trustworthy in its entirety (or at least the parts mentioning Jesus).

The absurdity of this argument is probably best illustrated with an example. We can archeologically verify many of the places and events of Homer's Iliad, which was likely written around the same time as some of the oldest parts of the Bible. Does that mean we should believe everything in the Iliad or everything that the main character says? Of course not, unless you think it's also reasonable to believe in Zeus, Hara, Artemis, Apollo, etc. These were all gods in the book, so that means we should believe everything the book says about them, right?

I once knew a pastor who recommended Josh McDowell's book to his congregation. He claimed this book proved that Christianity isn't intellectually bankrupt. I couldn't disagree more. This book may be my single biggest source in realizing that the inerrant camp of Christianity *is* intellectually bankrupt. If the basis of your most primary belief is a logical fallacy, there truly is no *there* there.
