title: Contradictions? What Contradictions?

I can't count the number of times I've seen this sort of exchange happen online:
>
Person 1: I don't believe in the Bible because of all of its contradictions.<br/>
Person 2: Contractions!? What contradictions??<br/>
Person 1: [Lists something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RB3g6mXLEKk)<br/>
Person 2: That's not a contradiction. You just don't understand the [context](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK7P7uZFf5o)!

Context and harmonization are common devices invoked by inerrantists for issues relating to biblical contradiction. According to the inerrantist, a contradiction isn't really a contradiction: you're simply not looking at the right context or you're not seeing how the verses harmonize.

Pretend we know two people named Bob and Joe. You think they're just normal people, but I think they're inerrant and cannot utter a falsehood. Now let's ask these two people a question:

What the weather was like last Tuesday?

Bob tells us that it was bright and sunny. Joe says it was dark and stormy. How would you, the normal person, and I, the inerrantist, respond to these statements?

You: One person is probably remembering the wrong day.<br/>
Me: You're missing the *context*. Maybe one person was referring to the morning and the other person was referring to the evening.

That's certainly possible, though already not the most likely conclusion. If the weather had actually changed throughout the day you'd think one of them would have at least mentioned it. *But a partial account isn't an incorrect account* I claim, so I'm going to continue to believe my inerrancy claim.

So we ask another question. What was the weather like at 12pm last Tuesday. Bob says it was bright and sunny. Joe says it was dark and stormy.

>
You: One person is probably remembering the wrong day.<br/>
Me: **CONTEXT!** Maybe Bob and Joe live on different sides of the city, and a storm rolled into one part of the city but not the other.

That seems like a much bigger stretch, but still *possible* I guess. Is it rational to come to such a conclusion? Isn't the most obvious answer that one person is just wrong?

So we probe even deeper. Bob tells us that it was bright and sunny the whole day, and there were no storms in the area. Joe says the storms covered the whole state the entire day.

You: One person is probably remembering the wrong day.<br/>
Me: These men are infallible, so we're obviously just not hearing them correctly. How can these two stories be **harmonized**? Bob must not be referring to the *literal* weather outside. He's referring to the "weather" surrounding him. He's really just talking about his surroundings. Bob must have been working inside all day in a very bright building. In actuality this gives us much better understanding of who Bob is!

We've come to the absurd of course, but inerrantists do this exact thing all the time. The interpretation of the text becomes the exact opposite of the "plain meaning" of the text. They've presupposed their conclusion that the Bible is both inerrant and entirely correct, and they are now working backward to make it so.

That's not even an exaggeration. Want to see Evangelicals twist texts to mean their literal opposites? Ask them about unforgivable sins, or if God changes his mind, or to explain the contradictory genealogies of Jesus, or whether man is saved by faith (through grace) or works? Watch how they explain texts to mean their complete opposite.

The fact of the matter is when you presuppose inerrancy, you can twist *anything* such that it doesn't contradict.

Would a rational person approaching the Bible honestly, without inerrancy in mind, come to these same conclusions? What if the logical conclusion is that the Bible contains real errors and contradictions?

This tale involved two humans in the realm of the natural. There's a limit to how far such logic can go when dealing with just the natural, but when God is involved, literal contradictions can still stand. Instead of being obvious contradictions, they're enshrined as showing the greatness or mystery of God. God is 3 and yet 1! God is sovereign over everything, yet man is still responsible for his sin! It's a demonstration of the mystery and greatness of God!

...or it's just a contradiction.
